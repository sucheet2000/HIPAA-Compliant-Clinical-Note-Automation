## History of Present Illness

**Physician:**  
I understand you've been experiencing some anxiety. Tell me about when that started.

**Patient:**  
It's been on and off for about six months, but it's gotten worse in the last month. I have these episodes where my heart races, I feel like I can't breathe, and I get very worried about everything.

**Physician:**  
How often are these episodes happening?

**Patient:**  
Maybe two or three times a week. They last anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour.

**Physician:**  
Do they happen at specific times or seem random?

**Patient:**  
Mostly in the evening or when I'm stressed about work. Sometimes they wake me up at night.

**Physician:**  
Any other symptoms like tremors, sweating, or difficulty concentrating?

**Patient:**  
Yes, actually I do get shaky during the episodes and I can't focus at work. I've been tired too.

## Assessment & Plan

**Physician:**  
I want to rule out any medical causes. Let's do some labs including:
- Thyroid function tests
- Complete metabolic panel

Pending those results, I think we should start you on a low dose of **sertraline**, an SSRI antidepressant that's effective for anxiety.

**Medication:**
- Sertraline 50mg daily

**Referrals:**
- Counseling for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)

**Follow-up:**
- 2 weeks to assess response to treatment
